        <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
        <p>
          Code 4 Community (C4C) is a student organization at Northeastern
          University focused on developing and maintaining software solutions
          for non-profit organizations within Boston. We empower our members via
          mentoring and workshops, while enabling them to connect with, give
          back to, and support the local community they live in. C4C strives to
          deliver work engineered with excellence and led by inclusive design
          principles to ensure our solutions are intuitive, performant, and
          deliver the best user experience.
