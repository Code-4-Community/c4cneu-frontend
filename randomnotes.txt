Random Notes (YAY)

1. Make the footer stick to the bottom on routes /events
2. Generally, we shouldn't be storing images in files because it makes the bundle
    pretty big. This will be fixed once s3 is up and running, but depending on loading
    speed, we might just want to keep them in the assets folder.
